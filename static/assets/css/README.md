# Styles for Food Oasis LA

Sections are grouped under headings with a “=” symbol,
to make searching easier.

When a style is used more than once, it sometimes has a “@keyword”
in a comment next to it (to help with search and replace).

For example…

16px  @font-size
24px  @line-height
32em  @page-max-width
